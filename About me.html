<p>My name is yoesel choki lhazin,this is my first web.Today I will be sharing little bit about myself.
Though I am not much in coding ,I thougth why waste time when i can learn to how to make my own website.<br><br>For the 
first time When I was coding I thougth it would be hard but,it was a little bit easy.I am proud of myself and also 
so happy to learn this coding if I didn't I would have not.As for the last sentences I am greatful to the 
principle of Lungthenzampa Middel Secondary School for giving me this opportunity.THANK YOU</p>
